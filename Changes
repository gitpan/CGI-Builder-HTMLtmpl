CGI-Builder-HTMLtmpl Latest Versions Changes

Version 1.2
- Fixed a problem related to pages with no templates
- Added the internal ht_exists method to check if a template file exists
  (without using the HTML::Template object)
- Added the ht_param group accessor in order to collect the params that will
  be passed to the internal ht object
- Deprecated the use of $s->ht->param() 
- The ht object becomes an internal object: added an advanced note about
  its use
- Added a few tests
- A few internal changes
- Added the "switch_to overriding" and the "CREDITS" POD sections

Version 1.1
- Added the page_content_check method
- Changed the page_content default sub: it prints the output in the RESPONSE
  phase thus avoiding to call HTML::Template::output() method before.
  This fixes a few problems reported in the ML
- A few minor changes in the Makefile.PL and the POD

Version 1.03

  ("phone home" opt-out) from Makefile.PL to make Randal L Schwartz happy :-)
