CGI-Builder-HTMLtmpl Latest Versions Changes

Version 1.1
- Added the page_content_check method
- Changed the page_content default sub: it prints the output in the RESPONSE
  phase thus avoiding to call HTML::Template::output() method before.
  This fixes a few problems reported in the ML
- A few minor changes in the Makefile.PL and the POD

Version 1.03
- Eliminated version check and installation feedback system
  ("phone home" opt-out) from Makefile.PL to make Randal L Schwartz happy :-)
  and sad the author :-(

Version 1.02
- Minor POD changes

Version 1.01
- Changed Makefile.PL version check
- Minor POD changes

Version 1.0
